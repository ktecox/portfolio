			I created this poster in the fall of 2013. It advertises the various events
			that were occurring on the Michigan State University campus in honor of the 
			Transgender Day of Remembrance. This poster was distributed throughout campus,

		class Introduction to Professional Writing in the spring of 2014. For the project, 
		I collaborated with two other students, however I created the handout alone. This 
		handout was used to supplement the presentation, which was on the affects that 
		technology is having on the field of book editing and publishing.</div>
