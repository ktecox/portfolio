		<p>Hello, and welcome to my website!</p>
		<p>I am Katherine Cox, and I am currently majoring in English at Michigan 
		State University, and upon graduating I will enter a year-long internship, 
		and at the end of this process, I will be certified to teach English/Language 
		Arts at the secondary education level in the state of Michigan. I also hope to 
		complete a minor in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Language (TESOL).</p> 
		<p>On the personal front, I am an avid reader. At this moment, my favorite book 
		is <i>Brave New World</i> by Aldous Huxley, but my favorite author is Tamora Pierce. 
		I am also a huge How I Met Your Mother, Game of Thrones, and Glee fan--and I'm also
		loving Resurrection.</p>
		<p>On this website, you can find examples of my previous work, my resume, and various 
		ways to contact me, should you have any questions. Enjoy!</p>
